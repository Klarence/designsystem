# Web Components

Storybook is a powerful tool for developing UI components in isolation. It allows developers to create, test, and document UI components outside the main application, facilitating iterative development and visual unit testing. Using Storybook, you can explore each component independently, test different variations (or "stories") of each component, and check how they behave in different scenarios.
Components are derived from the fantastic Shoelace web component library.
