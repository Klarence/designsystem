Japanese cuisine encompasses the regional and traditional foods of Japan,
which have developed through centuries of political, economic, and social
changes. The traditional cuisine of Japan (Japanese: washoku) is based on rice
with miso soup and other dishes; there is an emphasis on seasonal ingredients.
Side dishes often consist of fish, pickled vegetables, and vegetables cooked in
broth. Seafood is common, often grilled, but also served raw as sashimi or in
sushi. Seafood and vegetables are also deep-fried in a light batter, as tempura.
Apart from rice, a staple includes noodles, such as soba and udon. Japan also
has many simmered dishes such as fish products in broth called oden, or beef in
sukiyaki and nikujaga.
Historically influenced by Chinese cuisine, Japanese cuisine has also opened up
to influence from Western cuisines in the modern era. Dishes inspired by foreign
food-in particular Chinese food-like ramen and gyoza, as well as foods like
spaghetti, curry, and hamburgers, have been adapted to Japanese tastes and
ingredients. Traditionally, the Japanese shunned meat because of Buddhism, but
with the modernization of Japan in the 1880s, meat-based dishes such as
tonkatsu and yakiniku have become common. Japanese cuisine, particularly
sushi and ramen, has become popular throughout the world.
Osechi-ryori are traditional Japanese New Year foods. The tradition started in the
Heian period (794-1185). Osechi are easily recognizable by their special boxes
called jubako, which resemble bentō boxes (figure 1). Like bento boxes, jubako
are often kept stacked before and after use.
